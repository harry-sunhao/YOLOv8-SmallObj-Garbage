# YOLOv8-SmallObj-Garbage
Object detection is one of the cornerstone tasks in the field of computer vision, playing a pivotal role in many contemporary applications like autonomous driving, medical image analysis, and automated surveillance. With the growing global garbage, applying object detection techniques to automated garbage classification becomes increasingly imperative. While the YOLO series has excelled in various detection scenarios, the detection of small objects remains a vexing challenge. In addressing this, we present an augmented YOLO model tailored for enhanced small object detection. We aim to validate its efficacy through garbage detection tasks, hoping that it not only boosts garbage detection accuracy but also brings substantial value to other related domains.
